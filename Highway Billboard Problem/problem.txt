Suppose that you are on a road that is on a line and there are certain places where you can put adver-tisements and earn money.
The possible locations for the ads are x1, x2, â€¦, xn. The length of the road is M kilometers. The money you earn for an ad at location xi is ri > 0.
Your restriction is that you have to place your ads within a distance more than 4 kilometers from each other.
Design a dynamic programming algorithm that gives the combination of ad placements such that you maximize your total money earned.
